# Number Cardinality Checker

Number Cardinality Checker is an app that takes an integer as input and returns a string based on the cardinality of the number. If the number ends in a 0, the app returns the string "zero". If the number ends in a 5, the app returns the string "five". If the number is even (divisible by 2) and does not end in a 0, the app returns the string "even". If the number is odd (not divisible by 2) and does not end in a 5, the app returns the string "odd".

### Features:

`Accurate results`: The app accurately determines the cardinality of the input number and returns the correct string as output.
