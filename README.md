# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Number Cardinality Checker

Number Cardinality Checker is an app that takes an integer as input and returns a string based on the cardinality of the number. If the number ends in a 0, the app returns the string "zero". If the number ends in a 5, the app returns the string "five". If the number is even (divisible by 2) and does not end in a 0, the app returns the string "even". If the number is odd (not divisible by 2) and does not end in a 5, the app returns the string "odd".

### Features:

`Input`: The app takes an integer as input.
`Output`: The app returns a string as output, which can be one of the following: "zero", "five", "even", or "odd".
`User-friendly interface`: The app has a simple and easy-to-use interface that allows users to input a number and receive the corresponding string as output.
`Accurate results`: The app accurately determines the cardinality of the input number and returns the correct string as output.
`Instantaneous response`: The app provides instantaneous results, allowing users to quickly determine the cardinality of their input number.

Example Usage:
Input: 100
Output: "zero"

Input: 88
Output: "even"

Input: 155
Output: "five"

Input: 99
Output: "odd
